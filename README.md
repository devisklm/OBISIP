# Iris Flower Classification
Problem Statement:-
Iris flower has three species; setosa,versicolor, and virginica, which differs sccording to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flower according to their species, and here your task is to train a model that can learn rom the measurements of the iris species and clssify them.
Although the scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification.
Input:- Iris Flower measurements
Output:- Iris Flower type
Algorithm Used:- Decision tree Classifier
Steps involved :
1. Importing Dataset
2. Data preprocessing
3. Splitting dataset into train and test sets
4. Model Development
5. Model Evolution
6. Making predictions
This model can accurately classify type of the iris flower.

# Email Spam Classification
Problem Statement:-
We'he all been the receipient of spam emails before. Spam mail or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content. By using machine learning to train the model to recognise and classify emails into spam and non spam.
Input : messages
Output : spam/ham
Algorithm Used : Logistic regression
Steps involved :
1. Importing Dataset
2. Data preprocessing
3. splitting dataset into train and test sets
4. Model Development
5. Model Evolution
6.Making predictions

# Unemployment Analysis With Python.
Problem Statement : Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate of which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analysing the unemployment rate using Python.
Input : Unemployment Data
Output : State wise and Region wise Unemployment rate
Steps involved :
1. Import dataset
2. Data preprocessing
3. Data Analysis
4. Data Visualisation
